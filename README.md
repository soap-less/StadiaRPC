  <strong>Rich Presence integration for Stadia is here!</strong>
</p>


# Use the issues page or [join me on Discord](https://discord.gg/zU9HFm7) for suggestions or issues.
#### If you have any links(show up in your browser when you're playing a game, just exit fullscreen) to games that show as "missing" when you're playing, feel free to share them [here](https://github.com/soap-less/stadiajson/issues). They're very important to this project, and I am still missing a lot of them.


# What is this thing?
StadiaRPC is an **UNOFFICIAL** Google Chrome extension made for Stadia users which uses Discord Rich Presence to display what games you are currently playing.

# Getting Started
Getting started is really easy! Well not like super easy, but it's easy enough. 
1) Download the Discord-RPC-Extension Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/discord-rich-presence/agnaejlkbiiggajjmnpmeheigkflbnoo).
2) Download the Desktop application [here](https://github.com/lolamtisch/Discord-RPC-Extension/releases/tag/0.0.1).
3) Download the StadiaRPC Chrome extension file from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stadiarpc/dmhhgpkmilabgjpdbkinimkihdiobljg?hl=en&gl=US).
4) Run the Desktop application.
5) You're all good to go.

To use the extension, make sure the Discord-RPC-Extension desktop application is running and that all 3(2 extensions, 1 desktop app) items are installed.

# That's cool, but I have an idea to make it better...
Awesome! I love feedback, especially because I don't know what the hell I'm doing. If you want to give me some feedback, join the discord [here](https://discord.gg/zU9HFm7) and post it in #rpc-suggestions. I'll always take a bit of feedback.

# Credits/Rights
Huge shoutout to @lolamtisch for making the DiscordRPC/Chrome API. This project would be a hell of a lot harder without them.
